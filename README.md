## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- MySQL installed and running
- Git installed (optional)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanbhati/Library-Management-Sysytem.git
   cd Library-Management-Sysytem
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up MySQL Database**
   - Open MySQL and create a database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE library;
     ```
   - Configure the database in your Flask app by updating the connection string in the code:
     ```python
     conn = mysql.connector.connect(
         host="localhost",
         user="your_username",
         password="your_password",
         database="library"
     )
     ```

5. **Run the Flask Backend**
   ```bash
   python library_management.py
   ```

6. **Run the Streamlit Frontend**
   ```bash
   streamlit run libstream.py
   ```

7. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     - Streamlit Frontend: [http://localhost:8502](http://localhost:8502)
     - Flask Backend (if required): [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
